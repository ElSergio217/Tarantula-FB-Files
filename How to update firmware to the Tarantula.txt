All the steps you need to upload (new) firmware to the Tarantula:

1) Download "tarantula-marlin.community-v.0.1d.zip" from the 'files' section on this facebook group. (Maybe already a newer version available when you read this, please check)
2) Install the 'Arduino' software (download for free: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
3) Unzip the firmware zip file. Double click the 'marlin.ino' file. This will open the Arduino software automatically with this firmware loaded.
4) Choose correct settings in the Arduino software. Go to:
Tools -> Board -> Arduino Mega ADK
Tools -> Serial port -> (choose your COM port, mostly COM3)
5) Change firmware settings (if needed) in the 'configuration.h' tab
6) Click the 'upload' button (left upper corner (->). Make sure Tarantula is connected through USB and ON.
7) Wait till succesfully uploaded.
